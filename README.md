<h4 align="center">fam.ily is a platform designed for families and close friends. This app aims to provide a more private and intimate space for family members to connect and share their lives. With the restriction on interaction between family members and close friends, our platform provides a safe and secure environment for you to share personal moments, memories, and events.</h4>

<h6 align="center">This project has been cleaned up and forked from the original project hosted by Nhi Tran in a private repository named famApp</h6>
